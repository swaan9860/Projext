**3. System Architecture**

3.1 **Overview**

The register system will follow a client-server architecture. The client-side will consist of a web-based user interface accessible through web browsers, while the server-side will handle data storage, processing, and business logic. The system will employ a layered architecture, separating presentation, application, and data layers.

3.2 **High-Level Design**

The high-level design of the system will include:

- Presentation Layer: User interface components for user interaction.
- Application Layer: Business logic components for processing and validation.
- Data Layer: Database for storing user data, product information, and sales transactions.

3.3 **Low-Level Design**

The low-level design will involve detailed specifications of each system component, including database schemas, user interface wireframes, and data flow diagrams.
